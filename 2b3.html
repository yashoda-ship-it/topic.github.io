            <h2>1. Route Optimization with Graph Algorithms</h2>
            <p>Use <span class="highlight">Dijkstra’s Algorithm</span> for real-time route calculations. This algorithm ensures safe and efficient navigation by finding the shortest path from the car’s current location to its destination, considering obstacles and road conditions in real-time.</p>
            <p>Employ the <span class="highlight">Floyd-Warshall Algorithm</span> to precompute all-pairs shortest paths for robust navigation maps. This approach ensures that the self-driving car can quickly adapt to changes in the environment, providing a comprehensive navigation map that is updated dynamically based on real-time sensor data.</p>

        <div class="plan">
            <h2>2. Obstacle Detection with Sorting and Searching</h2>
            <p>Use <span class="highlight">Quick Sort</span> to prioritize obstacles by proximity. This sorting algorithm allows the self-driving car to quickly identify and address immediate threats, ensuring safe navigation through urban environments.</p>
            <p>Employ <span class="highlight">Binary Search</span> to quickly check maps for known hazards. This searching technique efficiently locates obstacles within the map, helping the car avoid hazards and navigate safely.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="plan">
            <h2>3. Decision Making with Dynamic Programming</h2>
            <p>Apply the <span class="highlight">Knapsack Problem</span> to balance energy efficiency, travel time, and passenger preferences. This dynamic programming approach enables the self-driving car to make optimal decisions regarding route selection based on multiple criteria, such as fuel efficiency and passenger comfort.</p>
