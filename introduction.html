    <h2 class="section-title">Design and Analysis of Algorithms – Course Introduction</h2>

    <p>The <strong>Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA)</strong> course focuses on understanding how to design, analyze, and implement efficient algorithms. Algorithms are the heart of problem-solving in computer science, as they dictate how tasks are solved with the least amount of time and space complexity. This course emphasizes both the theoretical foundations and practical applications of algorithms.</p>

    <h3 class="section-title">What is the Course About?</h3>
    <p>The <strong>DAA</strong> course explores various algorithmic techniques and their efficiency. It covers the design, analysis, and evaluation of algorithms using different approaches like Divide and Conquer, Dynamic Programming, Greedy Methods, Backtracking, and more. The goal is to understand how to select appropriate algorithms based on problem constraints and optimize them for real-world use.</p>
