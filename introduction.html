<h2>Course Project Introduction</h2>

<p> The **problem space** for smart cities comes from the challenges that fast-growing cities face, such as overcrowding, limited resources, outdated infrastructure, and environmental issues. To solve these problems, cities need to be more efficient, sustainable, and tech-savvy. This starts with figuring out the main issues by talking to everyone involved—governments, businesses, and citizens—and using tools like surveys and workshops to gather input. Key areas to focus on include traffic, energy use, waste management, public safety, and how people interact with city services. Modern technologies like smart sensors, artificial intelligence (AI), and big data are essential to finding solutions.

White papers on smart cities highlight the importance of using advanced tech to make cities run smoothly. For example, smart sensors and AI help monitor and improve things like traffic and energy use in real time, while blockchain technology ensures data is secure. Successful cities like Singapore, Barcelona, and Copenhagen have shown how these ideas work in practice, achieving benefits like saving energy, easing traffic, and making life better for residents. However, these projects also face challenges, like concerns about data privacy, cybersecurity risks, and the high costs of starting such projects. There’s also the issue of getting people on board, especially when they’re not familiar with the technology.

Designing a smart city involves building it in layers. The first layer is upgrading physical infrastructure to support new technologies. The second layer is about the tech itself—things like internet-connected devices and AI systems that help the city make better decisions quickly. Finally, the third layer focuses on the people who will use these services, making sure the technology is easy to use and actually improves their lives. Cities are also starting to use digital twins—virtual models of the city—to test out ideas before rolling them out in real life, which helps save time and money.

To make these projects financially viable, cities and businesses work together to share the costs and risks. They also create ways to earn money, such as charging for new services, licensing technology, or saving money through more efficient energy use. Tools like cost-benefit analysis help cities decide which projects are worth investing in and how to prioritize them.

In short, smart cities aim to use technology to solve everyday urban problems, making cities greener, more efficient, and better places to live for everyone. By planning carefully and including everyone in the process, these projects can create a brighter, more sustainable future.</p>
