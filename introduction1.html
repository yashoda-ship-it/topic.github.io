    <h1>Smart City Design and Business Cases</h1>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>Problem Space</h2>
        <p>The problem space revolves around urban challenges such as traffic congestion, energy inefficiency, public safety concerns, waste management, and logistics optimization. These were identified by observing inefficiencies in traditional urban management systems and understanding the need for technology-driven solutions.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Increasing urban population leading to congestion and higher resource demand.</li>
            <li>Environmental concerns from non-renewable energy and waste.</li>
            <li>Need for real-time data to improve urban services.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>Problem Definition</h2>
        <p>Surrounded by human habitat, there is an area of 1500 square kilometers that the government of India plans to transform into a smart city. Drawing lessons from challenges faced by projects like Amaravati and Naypyidaw, the government seeks a detailed and sustainable city plan proposal. Your task is to design a comprehensive city blueprint that ensures long-term viability, socio-economic integration, and environmental harmony.</p>
