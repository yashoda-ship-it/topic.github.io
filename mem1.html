  </ul>

  <p>**3. Take away from different design principles from Chapter 2**</p>
  <p>Chapter 2 emphasized the importance of choosing the right algorithmic design strategy for a problem. Techniques like divide-and-conquer (e.g., Merge Sort, Quick Sort) and greedy algorithms (e.g., Dijkstra's algorithm, Prim's algorithm) were discussed.

<p>9.Discuss about the different studied algorithm design techniques.</br></p>
<p>Ans:<strong>Algorithm Design Techniques</strong></br>
<strong>1. Divide and Conquer:</strong></br>
  The problem is divided into smaller subproblems that are solved independently and recursively, then combined to solve the original problem.</br>
   <strong>Process:</strong></br>
  1. Divide: Split the problem into smaller subproblems of the same type.</br>
  2. Conquer: Solve each subproblem recursively.</br>
  3. Combine: Merge the solutions of the subproblems to form the final solution.</br>
    <strong>Examples:</strong></br>
  - Merge Sort: Divides the array into halves, sorts them recursively, and merges the sorted halves.</br>
  - Quick Sort: Partitions the array around a pivot, then recursively sorts the partitions.</br>
  - Binary Search: Repeatedly divides the search space in half to find an element in a sorted array.</br>
   <strong> Applications:</strong></br>  
  - Sorting, searching, and matrix multiplication.</br>
    <strong>2. Dynamic Programming (DP): </strong></br> 
  Dynamic Programming is used to solve problems by breaking them into overlapping subproblems, solving each subproblem once, and storing the solutions . DP is typically used when the problem exhibits both optimal substructure and overlapping subproblems.</br>
  <strong>Process:</strong></br>
  1. Break the problem into smaller subproblems.</br>
  2. Solve each subproblem once and store the result.</br>
  3. Reuse the stored results to avoid redundant calculations.</br>
   <strong>Examples:</strong></br>
  - Fibonacci Sequence: Store intermediate results to avoid recalculating.</br>
  - Knapsack Problem: Find the maximum value achievable with a set of items under a weight constraint.</br>
  - Applications:</br>
  - Optimization problems, sequence alignment, and resource allocation.</br>
   <strong>3. Greedy Algorithms:</strong></br>  
   Greedy algorithms build a solution by choosing the locally optimal solution at each step, hoping to find a global optimum. These algorithms do not always guarantee the best solution, but they are often efficient.</br>
   <strong>Process:</strong></br>
  1. Select the best possible choice at each step.</br>
  2. Once a choice is made, it is final, and the algorithm proceeds to the next step.</br>
   <strong>Examples:</strong></br>
  - Prim’s Algorithm: Finds the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) by adding the smallest edge at each step.</br>
  - Kruskal’s Algorithm: Adds edges in increasing order of weight to form the MST.</br>
  - Huffman Coding: Constructs the optimal prefix-free code for data compression.</br>
   <strong> Applications:</strong></br>
  - Network design, scheduling, data compression, and resource allocation.</br>
   <strong>4. Backtracking:</strong></br>
    Backtracking is a trial-and-error approach where decisions are made incrementally. When a partial solution does not lead to a valid solution, the algorithm "backtracks" and tries alternative paths.</br>
    <strong>Process:</strong></br>
  1. Build a solution step by step.</br>
  2. If a step leads to an invalid solution, backtrack and try a different option.</br>
  3. Continue until a solution is found or all options have been explored.</br>
   <strong>Examples:</strong></br>
  - N-Queens Problem: Place N queens on an N×N chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other.</br>
  - Sudoku Solver: Try placing numbers in cells, backtrack if an inconsistency is found.</br>
  - Subset Sum Problem: Find subsets of numbers that sum to a given target.</br>
    <strong> Applications:</strong></br>  
  - Constraint satisfaction problems, combinatorial optimization, and puzzles.</br>
   <strong>5. Recursive Algorithms:</strong><br> Recursive algorithms solve problems by solving smaller instances of the same problem. Each recursive call reduces the problem's size until a base case is reached.</br>
<strong>Process:</strong><br>
  1. Break the problem down into smaller subproblems of the same type.<br>
  2. Solve the subproblem recursively.<br>
  3. Combine the results to form the final solution.<br>
   <strong>Examples:</strong><br>
  - Factorial Computation: Compute the factorial of a number by recursively multiplying it by the factorial of its predecessor.<br>
  - Tower of Hanoi: Move disks from one peg to another using a recursive strategy.<br>
  - Fibonacci Sequence: Calculate Fibonacci numbers recursively.<br>
  <strong>Applications:</strong><br>
  Divide and conquer problems, mathematical computations, and tree/graph traversal.</br> </p>
