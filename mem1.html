<p> 1.What are the kinds of problems we see in the nature?</p>
 <p> Ans:</br>https://github.com/yashoda-ship-it/topic.github.io/edit/main/mem1.html#L5C40</br><strong>Recursion:</br></strong>Recursion occurs when a function calls itself to solve smaller instances of a problem. It continues breaking the problem into smaller sub-problems until it reaches a base case, which stops the recursion.</br></p>
<p>2.What is space and time efficiency? Why are they important? Explain the different class of problems and orders of growth</p>
  <p>Ans:</p>
<p>3.Take away from different design principles from chapter 2</p>
 <p> Ans:</p>
<p>4.The hierarchical data and how different tree data structures solve and optimize over the problem scenarios (tree, bst, avl, 2-3, red-black, heap, trie)</p>
  <p>Ans:</p>
<p>5.The need of array query algorithms and their implications. Their applications and principles need to be discussed</p>
 <p> Ans:</p>
<p>6.Differentiate between tree and graphs and their traversals. The applications of each</p>
  <p>Ans:</p>
<p>7.Deliberate on sorting and searching algorithms, the technique behind each and they connect to real world</p>
  <p>Ans</p>
<p>8.Discuss the importance of graph algorithms with respect to spanning trees and shortest paths</p>
<p>Ans:</p>
<p>9.Discuss about the different studied algorithm design techniques.</p>
<p>Ans:      </p>
