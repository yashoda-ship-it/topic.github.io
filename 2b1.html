        <h1>Emergency Fire Detection</h1>
        <p class="highlight">Fire detection systems are crucial for early intervention and minimizing damage. Using IoT-based temperature and smoke sensors, these systems can detect fires in their initial stages. Efficient response plans rely on optimizing fire truck routes and analyzing high-risk areas.</p>

        <h2>Solutions/Plans:</h2>

        <h3>Fire Response Optimization with Graph Algorithms</h3>
        <div class="plan-highlight">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Use Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm:</strong> Calculate the shortest paths for fire trucks to fire sites, minimizing response time. By creating a weighted graph of roads and assigning weights based on travel time, this algorithm can quickly identify optimal routes, ensuring fire trucks reach the site as soon as possible.</li>
                <li><strong>Implement Bellman-Ford Algorithm:</strong> Handle situations with unpredictable road conditions, such as blocked roads. This algorithm accounts for negative weight edges, representing delays or detours, and recalculates paths dynamically to adapt to real-time conditions.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>Risk Assessment Using Greedy Algorithms</h3>
        <div class="plan-highlight">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Deploy Sensors:</strong> Place sensors in fire-prone zones and use Greedy Algorithms to prioritize high-risk areas for inspection. The algorithm evaluates risk levels based on historical fire data and ensures resources are allocated efficiently to maximize coverage.</li>
                <li><strong>Optimize Sensor Placement:</strong> Utilize Backtracking to ensure all critical areas are covered efficiently. This approach explores all possible configurations of sensor placement to achieve the best coverage with minimal overlap, ensuring no high-risk zones are left unmonitored.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>Predictive Monitoring with Divide and Conquer</h3>
        <div class="plan-highlight">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Analyze IoT Data:</strong> Use Merge Sort to prioritize regions based on risk intensity. The algorithm sorts regions by their risk scores, allowing emergency teams to focus on the most vulnerable areas first.</li>
                <li><strong>Locate Anomalies:</strong> Use Binary Search to quickly identify and address anomalies. After sorting sensor data, this algorithm pinpoints unusual readings efficiently, enabling prompt intervention before situations escalate.</li>
            </ul>
