    <h1>Road Condition Monitoring System</h1>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
        The Road Condition Monitoring System is a smart IoT-based solution designed to gather, process, and analyze real-time road conditions. By using advanced algorithms and data structures, it enables efficient traffic flow, enhanced safety, and optimal resource utilization.
    </p>

    <h2>Objective</h2>
    <p>
        To develop a real-time system that collects and processes data using intelligent algorithms, ensuring minimal latency in providing actionable insights for traffic management and safety.
    </p>

    <h2>SDG Goal</h2>
    <p>Sustainable Cities and Communities (Goal 11): This system contributes to sustainable urban infrastructure by optimizing traffic management and minimizing road hazards.</p>

    <h2>Data Representation</h2>
    <p>We model the road network as a graph:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Vertices:</strong> Sensor nodes deployed at intersections or critical points on roads.</li>
        <li><strong>Edges:</strong> Roads connecting these nodes, with weights representing traffic congestion, travel time, or hazard severity.</li>
    </ul>

            Stores connections between sensor nodes for efficient pathfinding and analysis.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>A* Search Algorithm</strong><br>
            Combines real-time data with heuristic estimation (e.g., distance to destination) for optimal route planning.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Prim’s Algorithm</strong><br>
            Builds a minimum spanning tree to ensure cost-effective deployment of sensors in a connected network.

            <strong>Data Transmission:</strong> Collected data is sent to the central processing system using a wireless network.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Analysis:</strong> Algorithms process data to identify hazards, congestion, or incidents.
