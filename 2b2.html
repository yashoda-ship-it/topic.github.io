    <h1>Road Condition Sensors</h1>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
        Road condition sensors are deployed to monitor and improve traffic flow and safety by providing real-time data on road conditions such as weather, traffic, and incidents. These sensors are a crucial part of smart city infrastructure, helping traffic management systems optimize routes and reduce accidents.
    </p>

    <h2>Objective</h2>
    <p>
        The objective is to implement an IoT-based system that continuously monitors road conditions, processes sensor data in real-time, and optimizes traffic management by providing intelligent routing recommendations. This system contributes to enhanced safety, reduced traffic congestion, and more efficient road usage.
    </p>

    <h2>SDG Goal</h2>
    <p>Sustainable Cities and Communities (Goal 11) - By improving road safety, reducing congestion, and enhancing traffic management, this system helps in the development of sustainable, resilient urban areas.</p>

    <h2>Data Representation</h2>
    <p>The road condition monitoring system can be modeled as a graph, where:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Vertices:</strong> Represent sensor nodes deployed at various road intersections or on-road segments.</li>
        <li><strong>Edges:</strong> Represent roads connecting the nodes. Each edge can have weights that represent traffic flow, travel time, or condition severity such as icy roads or accidents.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Real-World Data Used</h2>
    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Data Type</th>
                <th>Description</th>
                <th>Usage</th>
            </tr>

            </tr>

    </table>

    <h2>Algorithms and Data Structures</h2>
    <p>Several algorithms and data structures are used to process the sensor data and make real-time decisions. Here are some key components:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Shortest Path: Bellman-Ford Algorithm</strong><br>
            The Bellman-Ford algorithm is ideal for graphs with negative edge weights and is used to find the shortest path from a source to all other vertices, which helps in optimizing routes.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Clustering: K-Means</strong><br>
            K-Means is used to group nearby sensors with similar traffic conditions, helping reduce the amount of data transmitted and processed by focusing only on key areas with high traffic or hazards.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Real-Time Data Filtering: Kalman Filter</strong><br>
            The Kalman filter is applied to smooth noisy sensor data, especially for weather and traffic conditions, providing more accurate real-time updates.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Priority Queue: Min-Heap</strong><br>
            Used to prioritize urgent alerts and critical incidents in real-time, ensuring that the most important data is processed first.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Data Compression: LZW Algorithm</strong><br>
            The LZW algorithm is used to compress real-time sensor data to save bandwidth and storage space while maintaining accessibility for analysis and decision-making.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Process Flow</h2>
    <p>The system follows a multi-step process to manage road conditions in real-time:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>IoT sensors gather real-time data on weather, traffic, and incidents from various locations.</li>
        <li>The collected data is transmitted to a central processing system for analysis.</li>
        <li>Algorithms such as Bellman-Ford and K-Means process the data, optimizing traffic routes and identifying patterns.</li>
        <li>Traffic management systems are updated with optimized routes, alerts, and recommendations for both drivers and operators.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Optimization Techniques</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Real-Time Updates:</strong> Algorithms like BFS/DFS continuously update traffic flow and incident data to keep systems up-to-date and allow for dynamic rerouting.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Risk Assessment:</strong> A combination of algorithms prioritizes high-risk conditions based on severity. For example, icy road conditions or accidents are flagged for immediate rerouting.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Storage Efficiency:</strong> Real-time data compression using LZW reduces the volume of traffic data logs while maintaining efficient retrieval and analysis.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Future Enhancements</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Machine Learning Integration:</strong> Future systems will integrate machine learning models to predict traffic conditions and optimize routes based on historical data.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2X) Communication:</strong> Enhancements in V2X communication will enable direct communication between vehicles and infrastructure to improve traffic safety and management.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Expanded Coverage:</strong> As more sensors are deployed, the coverage area will increase, leading to more granular data and improved routing decisions.
        </li>
    </ul>
